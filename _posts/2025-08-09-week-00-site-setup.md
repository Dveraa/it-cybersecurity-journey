**Goal:**  
Stand up a public portfolio using GitHub Pages and set a repeatable workflow.

**What I did**  
- Created repo and license  
- Enabled GitHub Pages with the *minima* theme  
- Built homepage + posts system

**What I learned**  
- Repo “root” is where special files like `_config.yml` live  
- Posts go in `_posts` and must follow the `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` format so they show on the site automatically

**Next:**  
Build a weekly post template and connect Notion → GitHub.
