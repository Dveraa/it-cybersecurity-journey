I’m Diego — building a strong IT foundation before specializing in cybersecurity. This site tracks my weekly labs, what I break, and what I learn fixing it.

**Currently learning:** Linux, Windows admin, networking, scripting, and security basics.  
**Goal:** Land an IT role in 6–12 months while narrowing into a security path.
